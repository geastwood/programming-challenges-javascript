## compression

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabbcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. if the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return original string. You can assume the string has only upper and lower case letters.
